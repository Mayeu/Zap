          Zap : Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem

This is an university project to illustrate the use of elliptic curve in
crytography.

Goal of the project
===================

* Using GMP
* Implement the following operation on points of Weierstrass curve:
   * additive inverse
   * addition
   * P + P
   * nP
* Calculation of the order of a point
* Diffie-Hellman protocol
* Massey-Omura cryptosystem
